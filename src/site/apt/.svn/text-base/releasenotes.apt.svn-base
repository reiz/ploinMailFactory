  * CR: MailFactory - the init() method doesn't have to be called explicitely anymore. If not called explicitely, it is also called from the methods automatically.
  
  * CR: MailReplacer - There are now two "kinds" of keys you can use:<br>
   * Keys of the (old) form ":key" will trigger the replacement of all occurences of ":key" in the templateText. <br>
   * Keys without starting ":" like "key" will trigger the replacement of all occurences of "#{key}" in the templateText.
  
  * BugFix: Variable-replacement with values from the properties-files now works again (for subject, emailadresses and names (for "to", "cc", "bcc"))  

* from 1.3 to 1.3.1

 * BugFix: MaiilSender.setServerProperties checks the authUser and authPassword for null values

 * CR: The constructor of the MailFactory is empty. There is a new init() method in the MailFactory for better integration with the Spring Framework.
